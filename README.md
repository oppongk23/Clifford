<!-- ## About me -->
Hey there, Clifford here!

If you are here it means I probably did something right.

I try to do simple things successively to finish something bigger. I write because I enjoy talking and I do that a little too much sometimesðŸ˜¬. My interests lie mostly in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science. I find _**Computer Vision**_ and _**Natural Language Processing**_ very fascinating. You'll find that many of my projects are in this area. 

I also have an active interest in Underwater Optical Communications and I may have a project or two on that.

You can find all my [projects here](https://oppongk23.github.io/Projects/). 
I can be contacted via [Email](mailto:coboakyemensah@gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__oppong), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-boakye-mensah-031aa8142/).
