<!-- ## About me -->
Hey there, Clifford here!

If you are here it means I probably did something right.

I try to do simple things successively to finish something bigger. I write because I enjoy talking and I do that a little too much sometimesðŸ˜¬. My interests lie mostly in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science. I find Computer Vision and Natutral Language Processing very fascinating. You'll find that many of my projects are in this area. 

I also have an active interest in Underwater Optical Communications and I may have a project or two on that.

You can find all my [projects]() here. 
I can be contacted via [Email](mailto:coboakyemensah@gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__oppong), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clifford-boakye-mensah-031aa8142/). 


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/oppongk23/Clifford-Boakye-Mensah/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/oppongk23/Clifford-Boakye-Mensah/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
